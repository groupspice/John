<noscript> Leader’s Notes4. The Word already existed at the beginning of the universe. The Word was with God, yet the Word was God. (Passages like this lead us to understand God as a Trinity, three persons in one God.) Verses 3–5 tell us that through the Word all things were made; nothing was made without him. Life was in him, and the Word’s life is the light of people. He is the light in many ways. For instance, in the sense of pure goodness, pure truth—illumination for those who are confused, goodness that triumphs over evil. John calls him “the Word” for many reasons. For instance, the Word reveals God the way a person’s words express who he is. Also, when God speaks, powerful things happen. The Word is powerful, active.5. Both verses speak of the beginning and creation. Genesis says in the begin- ning God created . . . , whereas John 1:1 says in the beginning was. . . . The conclusion is that the Word existed even before God created our physical universe.6. In 1:14 John applies human attributes to the Word. He applies personal pronouns to the Word and says, “the Word became  esh and made his dwelling (or lived) among us.” This “becoming  esh” tells us that the Word is Jesus Christ, God in human  esh. Jesus was personally involved in the creation of our universe. He is also the source of spiritual enlightenment, and real life is found in him.7. John came as a witness to con rm that the light (the Messiah) had come andwhatthatmeanttohumanity.AsChrist’sfollowers,itisimportantthat we con rm to the world around us that Jesus is the way to true life.8. Jesus came  rst to those of his own lineage, the Jews, and they didn’t receive him.9. Although most of Jesus’s fellow Jews rejected him, some believed. And some non-Jews believed. All of these, Jews and non-Jews, who received him (believed in his name) were given the right to become children of God. That o er of rebirth as God’s child remains for people today. To be born of God is to come alive spiritually with a new family identity (God’s family) and new “DNA” guiding who we will grow up to be.10. The Word, Jesus, revealed his glory to humanity by descending into the world as a  esh-and-blood human being. As Christ lived among his disciples, he displayed attributes of God such as grace, mercy, wisdom, righteousness, truth, etc. These attributes reveal God’s unfailing love and faithfulness to humanity. The divine Word’s willingness to humble himself to take on human  esh shows God’s passionate, no-holds-barred love for humans.11. Through Jesus’s humanity we are able to see and understand God. Jesus is not merely a human re ection of God; he is God and therefore gives humanity the exact and authentic representation of God’s character. He126 </noscript>
