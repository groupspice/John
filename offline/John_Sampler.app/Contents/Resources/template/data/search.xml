        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities. You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your7]]></text>

A Deepening Life Together: John Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Jim Garlow. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide, you will  nd space for your notes on the teaching segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’sscary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy 8]]></text>

It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstYou can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together series Bible study on the book of John. As we experience the next eight weeks together, John will take us through his eyewitness account of Jesus’s life, ministry, death, and resurrection. As we read, discuss, and re ect on the topic of each session, we will discover how God demonstrated Jesus’s true identity as the Messiah, the one through whom eternal life is gained.As John’s gospel begins, Jesus is revealed as the Word and creator of the heavens and the earth. He is the self revelation of God, who became a human being to bring light and life to all who believe in him. John relates various testimonies about Jesus’s identity as Messiah and king of Israel. Though Jesus comes into con ict with Israel’s leaders, through powerful signs and wonders he continues to reveal he is God’s anointed one. The  nal “sign” of John’s Gospel, the raising of Lazarus from the dead, serves as a preview of Jesus’s own resurrection and o ers further proof of his identity—the true ful llment of Israel, the one who supplies the bread of life from heaven, the Messiah, and the good shepherd over God’s  ock.This journey of discovery will make known God’s purposes for our lives. We will connect with our loving and faithful God and with other believers in small group community. We will become his hands and feet here on earth as he reveals our uniqueness and his willing- ness to use us. We will experience the closeness that he desires with us as we prayerfully respond to the principles we learn in this study and learn to place him  rst in our lives.11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONETHE PROLOGUE OF JOHNMemory Verse: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1 NIV).Words, when used e ectively, are powerful. They can demolish as- pirations; they can provoke war; and they can destroy relationships. On the other hand, words can inspire lives and transform ideas; they can propagate peace between nations; they can take us on journeys to places we’ve never been; they can provide hope for the oppressed.God has demonstrated the power of his words throughout Scrip- ture. He used the spoken word to create the universe and its inhabit- ants, to judge Satan after the fall, to o er the promise of reconcili- ation, and as we’ll see in the beginning of John, God uses the Word to draw us into a relationship with himself.ConnectingPrayer is a powerful way to connect as a group. Open your group with prayer and invite the Holy Spirit to lead you as you begin to learn about the life of Jesus Christ through the book of John.13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[JohnDeeper relationships happen when we take the time to keep in touch with one another between sessions. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you, write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone vol- unteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married and how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this small group study of John and what you expect to learn during the next eight weeks.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together. In the Appen- dix is a Small Group Agreement with the values most useful in developing and sustaining healthy, balanced small groups. Choose two or three values that you haven’t previously focused on, or have room to grow in, to emphasize during this study. Choose values that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.If your group is new, you may want to focus on welcom- ing newcomers or on sharing group ownership. Any group will quickly move from being the leader’s group to our group when everyone understands the goals of the group and shares a small role in accomplishing them. See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.3. Are you a letter or Christmas card writer? In one or two sen- tences, why or why not?14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Prologue of JohnGrowingThe Gospel of John begins with a narrative explanation of the na- ture and person of Christ and the meaning of faith in him. John’s driving purpose in writing this Gospel is to establish Jesus as the Son of God and Messiah.To get started, please read John 1:1–18 aloud.4. John begins his Gospel with the phrase, “In the beginning was the Word.” What does John 1:1–5 tell us about the Word? (See the Study Notes for more insight into the meanings of begin- ning and the Word.)What is signi cant about calling him “the Word”?5. Compare John 1:1–2 with Genesis 1:1. What similarities do you see in these verses? What point do you think John is trying to make?6. Now compare John 1:14 with what you read in John 1:1–2. Who do you understand the Word to be? Why?How does 1:3–5 de ne the role of the Word in creation and in our lives?7. In John 1:6–8 we learn that God sent John the Baptist. What was John sent to do?How is our role in the world similar to John the Baptist’s?8. To whom did Jesus come  rst? What was the result (John 1:10–11)?9. How are the people described in 1:12–13 di erent from the ones in 1:10–11?What does it mean to be “born of God”?10. How did Jesus reveal his glory according to John 1:14?15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[JohnWhat does this verse show us about God’s character?11. Although no one has ever seen God the Father, God the Son (Jesus) has revealed him through what he said and did. Why do you think it is important that Jesus came to us in human form? (See John 1:18, as well as Col. 1:15–20 and Heb. 1:3 for additional insight.)12. According to John 1:17, the law was given through Moses. Turn to Deuteronomy 32:46–47 and read these verses aloud. How important was the law to the Israelite people according to these verses?13. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17b). How would you describe the di erence between what Moses gave us and what Jesus gave us? See the Study Notes for de nitions of grace and truth.14. What is one thing about Jesus as described in John 1:1–18 that is important for you personally right now? Why does that truth about him matter to you?John 1:1–18 is a literary masterpiece that summarizes the Gospel’s main theme: Jesus the Word and Creator is the self-revelation of God who became a human being to bring light and life to all who believe in him.DevelopingJesus came to earth to ful ll a speci c purpose. Each of us has been given a purpose by God to ful ll. But we can only discover that purpose by spending time in the Bible and in prayer.15. Developing our ability to serve God according to the leading of the Holy Spirit requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?16]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Prologue of Johnt Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God.t Re ection. At the end of each session, you’ll  nd Re ec- tions Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study each week. These are provided to give you an oppor- tunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Psalm 119:11 says, “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you” (NIV). Medi- tation is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. One way to do this is to write a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere where you’re sure to see it often, such as your bathroom mirror, your car’s dashboard, or the kitchen table. Think about it as you get dressed in the morning, when you sit at red lights, or while you’re eating a meal. Re ect on what God is saying to you through his words. Consider using the passages provided in the Re ections pages in each session. As you meditate upon these Scrip- tures, you will notice them beginning to take up residence in your heart and mind.SharingJesus lived and died so that humanity might come to know him and be reconciled to God through him. His  nal words before his ascension as recorded in Acts 1:8 were: “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth . . .” (NIV). Through the Holy Spirit, we are empowered to be his witnesses to those around us.17]]></text>

In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in-  uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about your day-to-day activities this week, pay special at- tention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, or other parents at school or sporting events whom you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next week, we’ll talk about how we can begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him as well as how to help connect believers to Christian community.SurrenderingJust as Jesus was fully surrendered to the Father when he came to earth to do his will, we  nd our purpose when we surrender our- selves fully to God.17. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with our God. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with him. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.18. Before you close your group in prayer, allow everyone to answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Prologue of JohnStudy NotesWord (Logos): Logos means “word, message, report” and sometimes even “deed.” Logos is also used to refer to Jesus as God’s revelation of himself. Jesus was the Logos eternally, but at a point in history he took on human  esh.Beginning: The same term is used in the Greek translation of Gene- sis 1:1 where it assumes a timeless eternity, highlighting the eternal preexistence of the Word (Jesus Christ). Jesus has universal rather than local signi cance and he speaks with ultimate authority.Grace: Underserved acceptance and love received from another, es- pecially the characteristic attitude of God in providing salvation for sinners. The gospel speaks of God’s gift of unmerited salvation in Jesus Christ.Truth: Something that is accurate, real. But truth is not only in statements. This term can be used to describe God himself, who is the ultimate standard of what is true and real.For Deeper Study (Optional)Read through John 1; note the titles Jesus is given. How does John’s inclusion of these titles further demonstrate his purpose in writing this Gospel account?• The Word (v. 1)• The Light (v. 5)• The One and Only (v. 14)• The Lamb of God (v. 29)• The Son of God (v. 34)• Rabbi (v. 38)• Messiah (v. 40)19]]></text>

As you read the verses each day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1. The Son re ects God’s own glory, and everything about him represents God exactly. He sustains the universe by the mighty power of his command.

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too83]]></text>

The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.84]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.85]]></text>

Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty-palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, coleader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.119]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One The Prologue of JohnConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to answer this introductory question at this  rst session.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.We recommend talking about shared ownership of the group. It’s impor- tant that each member have a role. See the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.125LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notes4. The Word already existed at the beginning of the universe. The Word was with God, yet the Word was God. (Passages like this lead us to understand God as a Trinity, three persons in one God.) Verses 3–5 tell us that through the Word all things were made; nothing was made without him. Life was in him, and the Word’s life is the light of people. He is the light in many ways. For instance, in the sense of pure goodness, pure truth—illumination for those who are confused, goodness that triumphs over evil. John calls him “the Word” for many reasons. For instance, the Word reveals God the way a person’s words express who he is. Also, when God speaks, powerful things happen. The Word is powerful, active.5. Both verses speak of the beginning and creation. Genesis says in the begin- ning God created . . . , whereas John 1:1 says in the beginning was. . . . The conclusion is that the Word existed even before God created our physical universe.6. In 1:14 John applies human attributes to the Word. He applies personal pronouns to the Word and says, “the Word became  esh and made his dwelling (or lived) among us.” This “becoming  esh” tells us that the Word is Jesus Christ, God in human  esh. Jesus was personally involved in the creation of our universe. He is also the source of spiritual enlightenment, and real life is found in him.7. John came as a witness to con rm that the light (the Messiah) had come andwhatthatmeanttohumanity.AsChrist’sfollowers,itisimportantthat we con rm to the world around us that Jesus is the way to true life.8. Jesus came  rst to those of his own lineage, the Jews, and they didn’t receive him.9. Although most of Jesus’s fellow Jews rejected him, some believed. And some non-Jews believed. All of these, Jews and non-Jews, who received him (believed in his name) were given the right to become children of God. That o er of rebirth as God’s child remains for people today. To be born of God is to come alive spiritually with a new family identity (God’s family) and new “DNA” guiding who we will grow up to be.10. The Word, Jesus, revealed his glory to humanity by descending into the world as a  esh-and-blood human being. As Christ lived among his disciples, he displayed attributes of God such as grace, mercy, wisdom, righteousness, truth, etc. These attributes reveal God’s unfailing love and faithfulness to humanity. The divine Word’s willingness to humble himself to take on human  esh shows God’s passionate, no-holds-barred love for humans.11. Through Jesus’s humanity we are able to see and understand God. Jesus is not merely a human re ection of God; he is God and therefore gives humanity the exact and authentic representation of God’s character. He126]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesknows what it’s like to be a man and live in a fallen world. He has been here where we are. And when we read about how Jesus talked and behaved, we see God in action.12. Deuteronomy 32:46–47 tells us that the law is life; apart from keeping the law and the sacri ces, there is no hope of being in a right relationship with God.13. The law revealed God’s demand for holiness. This showed humankind our unrighteousness and therefore illuminated our need for a Savior. Jesus came as a demonstration of God’s grace (his undeserved favor despite our failure to obey him) and truth (his reliability as the standard of what is accurate and real). The Law can’t change us, but grace and truth can forgive us, restore relationship, and transform us.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.15. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.16. This activity should get the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people whom God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to small group.127]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesSurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.17. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.18. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in con dence if you are to have safety and bonding within the group members.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in each ses- sion. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two First Sign from the MessiahConnecting2. We encourage the group to rotate leaders and hosts homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Rotating host homes and leadership along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “your group” to “our group.”Growing4. John denies that he is the Christ, saying he is the voice of one calling in the wilderness, preparing the way for the Lord. In Isaiah 40:3, Isaiah hears a voice calling Israel to prepare for the Lord’s coming. The Lord is com- ing to free Israel from captivity in Babylon. Yet centuries later when John comes, the Jews are still under foreign domination, waiting for a Messiah who will free them. John humbly refers to himself as the voice who calls,128]]></text>
